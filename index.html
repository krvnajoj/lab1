      <p><strong>Russel Tiza Orhii</strong> (born: December 8, 1994) an American powerlifter who previously competed in the 83kg class, winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_championships_medalists_in_powerlifting_(men)">IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships</a> twice, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Powerlifting">USA Powerlifting</a> Raw Nationals five times and Powerlifting America Raw Nationals once. He has recently moved up to the 93 kg class and is yet to compete in this new class </p>
      <p>Orhii began competing in powerlifting in 2015 and quickly rose to prominence, qualifying for the IPF World Championships in 2018, where he set an open squat world record and placed second. He became IPF World Champion in 2019 in the 83 kg class, breaking multiple world records, and won his third IPF world title in 2021 while representing the United States Virgin Islands, again setting squat, deadlift, and total world records. After brief stints competing under USA Powerlifting in 2022 and navigating federation eligibility rules in 2023, Orhii returned to IPF competition, continuing to break world records. In 2024 and 2025, he set multiple historic squat and total world records at major international events, including the IPF World Championships, SBD Sheffield, and the Pan-American Championships, eventually moving up to the 93 kg class and totaling 918 kg with a 355.5 kg squat.</p>
